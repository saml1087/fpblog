Blog Entry # 1						     Date: 12/9/19


Today I completed the overview and filled out italics that reflected the project. (Where are you at in the process of your product? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp)

I learned about github commands that allowed me to push up into the remote repository. What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project? How will you use the synthesis practice we did today on your project?)

I used class instructions to direct me.What sources did you use to learn that? Some days this will just be class instruction.)

A skill that I used was using class notes to help get a better understanding of that subject. How are you developing in ways that apply outside of your project? See hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills
